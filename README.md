# 2DGT20-Collaborative
DATE: 27/07/2022
## Description
This is a project for a hypothetical school that needs an easier way to collect staff absences and assign relief teachers for them.
While not a finished product and the functionality is slightly convoluted for an administrating program, this project is mainly designed to test the collaborative skills of the partipants.
This means that each segment was designed and developed by different authors, hence the long list at the end of this .md.

## Brief overview
 - Project for a digital technologies course
 - Written in Python, with the use of .csv and .json files
 - Includes a GUI, written with the libraries of tkinter and customTkinter
 - This project was designed under the context of a school requiring a program - It builds on from previous assignments in this course.
